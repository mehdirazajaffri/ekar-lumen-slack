# Ekar Slack Integration

Lumen based API, Slack bot is integrated with a Lumen API that solves Euler Problem.

## How to use it

Currently application is only installed at my workspace mehdirazajaffri@gmail.com, so you would be needing my credentials to Play around it.

## How it works

At any channel in your slack, just mention my bot like this

hey @ekarslack solve for 99

Solve keyword is neccessary to intimate bot..

You can type anything after mentioning bot , you text message must contain a number and also a keyword "solve".

## Setup .env

BOT_TOKEN=Bearer xoxb-793684583653-780912309122-RQywBcBMnpM5ZeCAgJYeE6567
